# Core Tripal 4 Development Task

<!---
Fill out the branch name attached to this task below. The various tokens mean:

- `tv4g[0-9]` indicates the functionality group the branch relates to. See tags for groups available.
- `issue\d+` indicates the issue describing the purpose of the branch. By making a new issue for each 
   major task before we start working on it, we give room for others to jump in and save you time if 
   something is already done, beyond scope, or can be made easier by something they are working on!
- `[optional short descriptor]` can be anything without spaces. This is meant to make the branches more 
   readable so we donâ€™t have to look up the issue every time. You are encouraged to only have one branch 
   per issue! That said, there are some edge-cases where multiple branches may be needed (i.e. partitioned 
   reviews) where variations in the optional short description can make the purpose of multiple branches clear.
